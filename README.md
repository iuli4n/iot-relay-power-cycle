# iot-relay-power-cycle

This code is intended to drive a relay that turns on power to a circuit at specific intervals, such as turning on/off a fan through an IOT Relay

# Hardware needed
* An Arduino
* A power strip that is controlled by a relay, like this one: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14236

# How to use
* Connect an Arduino to the relay using two pins: 10 and GROUND.
