# iot-relay-power-cycle

This code is intended to drive a relay that turns on power to a circuit at specific intervals, such as turning on/off a fan through an IOT Relay

To use it, connect an Arduino to the relay using two pins: 10 and GROUND. 
Then update the code to specificy the on/off periods and loops.
